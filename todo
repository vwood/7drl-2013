DONE: Add midpoint displacement to DVector 
DONE: Create Poisson disc alg.
DONE: Create 2d map object (tiles)

TODO:
* Finish 2d map objects
  - Hill
  - Wave
  - Lake
  - Land (v. large polys (always drawn first))
  - Replace colours with single colour list
  - Display type of tile by blocks of colour under the map objects
* Create tile definitions
** Create poly areas
   - just use random maps for now
   - Generate poisson positions limited to a poly
* Draw map from objects
  - Sorted objects by Y
  - Separated in to different vectors based on Y? - allows for us to avoid drawing everything
  - Set tile info from objects
* Add actor objects
  - stored on map
* Add basic UI
  - 2 panels
* Add basic AI (chase player)
  - and scripting/events - countdown to generation from caves
** Improve AI (chase nearest)
  - AI should store current task, only change with turn delay (i.e. plan ahead one)
* Add troops
** Add troopeffects
  - Block enemies
  - Healing
  - Reveal enemies current AI task
  - Stealth
  - Extra sight
** LoS/FoV (simple circles)
* Path finding (combination of fields) 
  - tiles block movement
* Add 'combat'
* Add death
** Add win conditions
** Time limit? 7 game days?
*** Increase line width via quads / rects / polys
   - Hardish to do (vertex array?)
