DONE: 
Add midpoint displacement to DVector 
Create Poisson disc alg.
Create 2d map object (tiles)
Create tile definitions
Add test that reruns test when hitting SPACE
Hill
Lake
BUG: Assignment of points to tiles is incorrect (probably test with points @ X & Y)
- Replace colours with single colour list
Land
Display type of tile by blocks of colour under the map objects
Create poly areas
just use random maps for now

TODO:
* Finish 2d map objects
  - Desert?
  - Replace colours with generated colour regions (certain forests are same colour?)
  - Maps larger than screen
	- Zoom + movement

    TODO : Generate poisson positions limited to a poly
     - Use poisson generation to generate points for polys to generate tiles
     - No: Colour them based on their proximity to higher points/poly?
     - Can have surrounding rectangle for water
* Draw map from objects
  - Sorted objects by Y
  - Separated in to different vectors based on Y? - allows for us to avoid drawing everything
* Add actor objects
  - stored on map
* Add basic UI
  - 2 panels
* Add basic AI (chase player)
  - and scripting/events - countdown to generation from caves
** Improve AI (chase nearest)
  - AI should store current task, only change with turn delay (i.e. plan ahead one)
* Add troops
** Add troopeffects
  - Block enemies
  - Healing
  - Reveal enemies current AI task
  - Stealth
  - Extra sight
** LoS/FoV (simple circles)
* Path finding (combination of fields) 
  - tiles block movement
* Add 'combat'
* Add death
* Improve text rendering (multiple colours, etc)
** Add win conditions
*** Increase line width via quads / rects / polys
   - Hardish to do (vertex array?)
