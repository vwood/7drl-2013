DONE: Add midpoint displacement to DVector 

TODO:
* Create 2d map object (tiles)
* Probably switch to a point struct - vector iteraton alone is probably worth it
* Create Poisson disc alg.
* Create poly areas
* Draw map from objects
* Sorted objects by Y
* Add actor objects
  - stored on map
* Add basic UI
  - 2 panels
* Add basic AI (chase player)

  - Reveal enemies current AI task
  - Stealth
